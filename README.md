# Gasho's Database service provider on AWS
A project for the PHP and Cloud Technologies courses @ New Bulgarian University 

This project aims to provide a very simple Web User Interface, which can be used to request
Database (for example MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc..) instances, which are hosted on AWS. The end user
receives a url, consisting of a hostname and a port, which can be later used for different applications,
requiring database.

In this project the following technologies will be used:
- AWS IaaS
- PHP for the backend
- OpenUI5 for the frontend
- Docker, for bundling everything together
